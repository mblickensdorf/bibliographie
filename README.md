Intents to be a bibliography management tool that derives from the database scheme of Aigaion v2.1.2.
You can also use it with the current database scheme version v2.2, but when we began the project we started with the v2.1.2.

Bibliographie aims to tackle some problems of Aigaion like the old code base, slowness for large databases, problems with multihierarchical graphs and adds some neat functionality too, that make it easier to cope with a lot of literature.

# Get it running #
## 1. step: config file ##

You need a config file named 'config.php' that you put in the root of this app. The file should look something like that:

```php
<?php
// MySQL connection data
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_MYSQL_HOST', 'host');
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_MYSQL_USER', 'user');
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', 'password');
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_MYSQL_DATABASE', 'database');

// Root path of bibliographie without ending slash.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_WEB_ROOT', '/bibliographie');

// Minimum of chars needed to start a search. Should be the same as the minimum length of MySQL fulltext index length.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_SEARCH_MIN_CHARS', 4);

// Configuration for the tag cloud.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_TAG_SIZE_FACTOR', 100);
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_TAG_SIZE_MINIMUM', 10);
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_TAG_SIZE_FLATNESS', 40);

// If you have a key for ISBNDB.com put it here.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_ISBNDB_KEY', '');

// One of 'errors', 'all' or false
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_DATABASE_DEBUG', false);

// Wether to use caching or not. Highly recommended for large databases.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_CACHING', true);

// Prefix for the mysql tables.
define('BIBLIOGRAPHIE_PREFIX', 'a2');
```

## 2. Step ##

You need a server side directory authentication, e.g. via apaches .htaccess. And the appropriate authentication names in the database table `users` with the names in the `login` field.
If you have the user 'foobar' in your .htaccess file, you'll need a row in the `users` table with the login field having the value 'foobar'.
For users that get authenticated by the server bibliographie will automatically create the appropriate row in the `users` table.

## 2.1 Step ##

You might have to give the webserver access to the installation directory. (e.g. under Ubuntu/Linux: chown www-data /var/www/bibliographie)
You might also have to give the files write permissions. (e.g. chmod 0775 for all files)
Those two steps depend on your environment. (e.g. you don't need to take care of that on Windows)

## 3. Step ##

Access the app via a browser at the path you've set in the config file earlier. Follow the instructions to convert/create the database scheme.

+## 4. Installing and configuring of search system ##
+
+First you have to install ElasticSearch from http://www.elasticsearch.org/ . Then you need to install the Java Databaseconnector (JDBC) from https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc . Then the db content must be initialized from Elastic Search. There are various ways e.g. with curl or http://voormedia.com/blog/2014/06/four-ways-to-index-relational-data-in-elasticsearch
+with curl:
+```
+curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/product/_meta -d '
+ {
+ "type": "jdbc",
+ "jdbc": {
+ "user": "user",
+ "password": "pass",
+ "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bib_db",
+ "sql" : "select * from a2author"
+ }
+ }'
+```
+Then you have to install php composer like http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/_quickstart.html .
+
+

## Reach the finish line ##

All done... You can now start using bibliographie...

* If you're new to bibliographie and do not have an aigaion databaase you'll have a meta-topic called "Top" that is used as the top of the topic graph.
So put all your topics in there so they'll show up in the topic graph.
